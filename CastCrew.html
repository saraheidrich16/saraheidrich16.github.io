							<h2 class="posttitle">Steven Spielberg <br /> Director</h2>
							<p>One of the most influential personalities in the history of cinema, Steven Spielberg is Hollywood&#8217;s best known director and one of the wealthiest filmmakers in the world. </p>
							<p>He has an extraordinary number of commercially successful and critically acclaimed credits to his name, either as a director, producer or writer since launching the summer blockbuster with Jaws, and he has done more to define popular film-making since the mid&#8211;1970s than anyone else.</p>
							<p>Spielberg has been extremely active in films there are many other things he has done as well. He produced the short-lived TV series SeaQuest 2032 (1993), an anthology series entitled Amazing Stories (1985), created the video-game series "Medal of Honor" set during World War Two, and was a starting producer of ER (1994). Spielberg, if you haven't noticed, has a great interest in World War Two. He and Tom Hanks collaborated on Shooting War (2000), a documentary about World War II combat photographers, and he produced a documentary about the Holocaust called Eyes of the Holocaust (2000). With all of this to Spielberg's credit, it&#8217;s no wonder that he&#8217;s looked at as one of the greatest ever figures in entertainment.</p>

							<h2 class="posttitle">Henry Thomas <br /> Actor / Elliott</h2>
							<p>Henry Thomas was born on September 9, 1971 in San Antonio, Texas, USA as Henry Jackson Thomas Jr. He is an actor and producer, known for E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</p>
							<p>Thomas said that he decided he wanted to become an actor at age eight, after watching a PBS special on acting and realizing he had found his calling. After landing a part at an open audition in a San Antonio hotel, Thomas made his film debut in Raggedy Man (1981). At age nine, Thomas auditioned for the lead role in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). He won the part by giving a genuinely tearful performance, during which he drew upon his real-life trauma of having seen his pet dog being killed by a neighbor's dog. The film's success exceeded expectations, and Thomas was troubled by the sometimes extreme reaction of the public. Thomas starred in Cloak &amp; Dagger, while attending school. He returned to film in the late 1980s and early 1990s and began to prove himself in adult roles, most notably as the younger version of Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates character in Psycho IV: The Beginning.</p>

							<h2>1980s</h2>
							<p>Barrymore's professional career began at eleven months, when she auditioned for a dog food commercial.

After her film debut with a small role in Altered States (1980), she played Gertie in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), directed by Steven Spielberg. He felt that she had the right imagination for her role after she impressed him with a story that she led a punk rock band.

The same year, she played a young girl divorcing her famous parents in Irreconcilable Differences, for which she was nominated for her first Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. In a review in the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert stated, "Barrymore is the right actress for this role precisely because she approaches it with such grave calm."</p>
                            <p>She endured a troubled youth and continued to act intermittently during the decade. She starred in the 1985 anthology horror film Cat's Eye, written again by Stephen King. The film received positive reviews and Barrymore was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Leading Young Actress.She starred alongside Jeff Bridges and Alice Krige in the 1989 romantic comedy See You in the Morning. Vincent Canby of The New York Times criticized "the fashionable phoniness" of the film, but positively singled out Barrymore for her performance.</p>
                            <p>After her twelve-day rehab treatment at ASAP, Barrymore starred in Far from Home (1989), as a teenager who gets stranded with her father in the small town in a remote part of the desert. The film went largely unnoticed by audiences and received negative reviews from critics, who dismissed the sexual portrayal of her role.</p>
